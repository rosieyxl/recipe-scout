APS360: Intro to Deep Learning | Course Final Project


**Introduction:**
As students, we are constantly asked to balance rigorous academics with other aspects of our lifestyles, and nutrition is often overlooked. In a study done on students from Universiti Brunei Darussalam, it was discovered that more than half did not eat breakfast regularly and that the majority consumed little fruits and vegetables compared to fried foods and other snacks. As such, our team has decided to explore deep learning as a means to help select recipes and limit meal-prep indecision. In particular, we decided to focus on fruit and vegetable-based recipes, one of the main food groups which cannot be neglected in a healthy diet. 

The goal of our project is to build and train a deep learning model, Recipe Scout (RS), which can correctly identify up to five fruit(s)/vegetable(s) present in an image inputted by the user. RS will then index through a data set of recipes, and select ones which list the identified fruits/vegetables as needed ingredients. These recipes, complete with instructions, will then be returned to the user. With Recipe Scout, users can take a picture of what they already have on hand, and receive immediate guidance on what snacks or meals they can prepare.

This project requires accurate classification of multiple elements amongst noisy backgrounds, which is why the team believes deep learning is a reasonable approach. Deep learning networks have the ability to learn complex features and generalize, which will prove useful in recognizing fruits and vegetables in user-inputted images which have not been cleaned.
